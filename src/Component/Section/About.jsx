                    <p>I graduated from Comsats University Islamabad, Lahore Campus.
                        Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. I cannot say with 100%
                        confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is.
                        The world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional experience
                        to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take
                         and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges
                         and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly.
                         I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop
                         high-quality and unique products</p>
